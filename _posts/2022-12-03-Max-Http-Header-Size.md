### Introduction to TestRestTemplate

### Configuration


### How to write a test with ```TestRestTemplate```

### Notes

Because  ```@SpringBootTest``` needs all application contexts, these tests spend more time than unit tests. It can cause some 
delay to your build pipeline, they should be configure wisely. Also it is a good practice to configure it with a different profile.
 

### Result

So Spring starts the server and make the tests as much as close to production environment.

You can find the all project [on Github](https://github.com/muzir/softwareLabs/tree/master/spring-boot-integration-test)
